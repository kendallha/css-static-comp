# Responsive CSS Static Comp

## Overview

This project involved recreating a static comp using responsive CSS design. The layout was required to match that of the comp, but the remainder of the design is based off of my own creative choices. 

The project spec can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/m1-static-comp).
